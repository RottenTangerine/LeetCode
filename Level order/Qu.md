[Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Example 1:

```python
root = [3,9,20,None,None,15,7]
```

Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

## Example 2:

```python
root = [1]
```

Output: [[1]]

## Example 3:

```python
root = []
```

Output: []
